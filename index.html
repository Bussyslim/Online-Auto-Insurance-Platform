            DEDUCTABLE: is a fixed contribution that must be paid each time a car in repaired using an automotive insurance police. It is also referred to as EXCESS.<br><br>
            
            COMPULSORY:  is a minimum excess payment the insurer will accept on the insurance policy. It varies according to the personal details, driving record and insurance company.<br><br>
            
            VOLUNTARY EXCESS: to reduce the insurance premium, the insured may offer to pay a higher excess than the compulsory excess demanded by the insurance company. Hence, the voluntary excess is the extra amount over and above the compulsory excess that has been agreed to be paid in the event of a claim on the policy.<br><br>
